# Pulmonary Fibrosis Severity Prediction

## üìã Overview

This project aims to predict the severity of decline in lung function for patients diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis using machine learning techniques. Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic lung disease characterized by scarring of the lungs, leading to difficulty in breathing. The severity prediction is based on **CT scan images** of the lungs, **metadata**, and baseline **Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)** measurements obtained from spirometry.

The goal is to assist clinicians and patients in understanding disease progression better, providing early prognosis insights that could influence treatment decisions and clinical trial designs.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Patients diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis face uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of the disease progression. Current methods for prognosis are limited, and there is a need for more accurate predictive models using **imaging data** and **clinical parameters**.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by the **Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC)**, a collaborative effort involving academia, industry, and philanthropy. It includes **CT scan images** of lungs along with metadata such as age, sex, and baseline FVC measurements.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **CT Image Processing**: Preprocessing CT scan images to enhance features relevant to lung fibrosis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting relevant features from metadata and spirometry data.

### 2. Model Development

- **Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)**: Utilizing a fully connected architecture to predict the severity of pulmonary fibrosis based on **FVC values**. The model processes the input FVC values through a series of linear transformations to produce the final output (severity score or predicted FVC decline).
  
- **FVCTransformer**: Implementing a custom neural network model, the `FVCTransformer`, that takes in FVC input values and applies a two-layer transformation to predict the severity of lung function decline in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. This model leverages dense layers to extract meaningful patterns from the FVC data.


### 3. Evaluation and Validation

- **Cross-Validation**: Assessing model performance through cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalization.
- **Performance Metrics**: Using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **Accuracy** to evaluate the model's precision in predicting future FVC values based on past data.

## üèÜ Results

The **FVCTransformer** model demonstrated promising results in predicting the **future FVC values** based on the previous 5 FVC measurements. With an **accuracy of around 85%** and a **confidence level** of **250 or higher**, the model accurately forecasted two future FVC values. These results provide valuable insights into the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, aiding clinicians in early intervention and improving patient management strategies.
